## Introduction
**Megrez-3B-Omni** is an on-device multimodal understanding LLM model developed by **Infinigence AI** ([Infinigence AI](https://cloud.infini-ai.com/platform/ai)). It is an extension of the Megrez-3B-Instruct model and supports analysis of image, text, and audio modalities. The model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in all three domains:
- Image Understanding: By utilizing SigLip-400M for constructing image tokens, Megrez-3B-Omni outperforms models with more parameters such as LLaVA-NeXT-Yi-34B. It is one of the best image understanding models among multiple mainstream benchmarks, including MME, MMMU, and OCRBench. It demonstrates excellent performance in tasks such as scene understanding and OCR.
- Language Understanding: Megrez-3B-Omni retains text understanding capabilities without significant trade-offs. Compared to its single-modal counterpart (Megrez-3B-Instruct), the accuracy variation is less than 2%, maintaining state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like C-EVAL, MMLU/MMLU Pro, and AlignBench. It also outperforms previous-generation models with 14B parameters.
- Speech Understanding: Equipped with the encoder head of Qwen2-Audio/whisper-large-v3, the model supports both Chinese and English speech input, multi-turn conversations, and voice-based questions about input images. It can directly respond to voice commands with text and achieved leading results across multiple benchmarks.

### Inference Speed

|                | image_tokens | prefill (tokens/s) | decode (tokens/s) |
|----------------|:------------:|:------------------:|:-----------------:|
| Megrez-3B-Omni |      448     |       6312.66      |       1294.9      |
| Qwen2-VL-2B    |     1378     |       7349.39      |       685.66      |
| MiniCPM-V-2_6  |      448     |       2167.09      |       452.51      |

Setup:  
- The testing environment utilizes an NVIDIA H100 GPU with vLLM. Each test includes 128 text tokens and a 720√ó1480 image as input, producing 128 output tokens, with `num_seqs` fixed at 8.  
- Under this setup, the decoding speed of Qwen2-VL-2B is slower than Megrez-3B-Omni, despite having a smaller base LLM. This is due to the larger number of image tokens generated when encoding images of the specified size, which impacts actual inference speed.

## Install

Install runtime dependencies with the following command:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The audio-related functionality relies on **FFmpeg** for audio processing. If you are using a Debian or Debian-based system, you can install FFmpeg with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```

For other operating systems, please refer to the [official FFmpeg documentation](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) for installation instructions.

## Inference

### Conversation with Multimodal Data

You can use the following script to chat with our model. Note that you should replace `PATH_TO_PRETRAINED_MODEL` with the path to the downloaded model checkpoint.

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM

path = "{{PATH_TO_PRETRAINED_MODEL}}"  # Change this to the path of the model.

model = (
    AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
        path,
        trust_remote_code=True,
        torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    )
    .eval()
    .cuda()
)

messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": {
            "text": "Please describe the content of the image.",
            "image": "./data/sample_image.jpg",
        },
    },
]

MAX_NEW_TOKENS = 100
response = model.chat(
    messages,
    sampling=False,
    max_new_tokens=MAX_NEW_TOKENS,
)
print(response)
```

You can also find a complete script in [example_chat_hf.py](example_chat_hf.py).

### Inference with vLLM

We provide a reference implementation of inference with vLLM framework. You can find the model definition in [vllm_demo/megrezo.py](vllm_demo/megrezo.py).

1. Install vLLM

```shell
pip install vllm==0.6.3.post1 flash_attn==2.5.8 xformers==0.0.27.post2
```

**Note**: To use vLLM for inference, it is essential to install specific versions of the dependencies. Other versions may lead to interface incompatibility risks. If you encounter any issues, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/infinigence/Infini-Megrez-Omni/issues/new).

2. Run the inference script

Since vLLM does not officially support MegrezO yet, you need to import the module first:

```python
from vllm import ModelRegistry
from megrezo import MegrezOModel

ModelRegistry.register_model("MegrezO", MegrezOModel)
```

Then, you can run inference with the following code:

```python
from PIL import Image
from vllm import LLM
from vllm import SamplingParams


# Load the model.
model_path = "{{PATH_TO_HF_PRETRAINED_MODEL}}"  # Change this to the path of the model.
llm = LLM(
    model_path,
    trust_remote_code=True,
    gpu_memory_utilization=0.5,
)

sampling_params = SamplingParams(
    temperature=0,
    max_tokens=1000,
    repetition_penalty=1.2,
    stop=["<|turn_end|>", "<|eos|>"],
)

img = Image.open("../data/sample_image.jpg")

conversation = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": {
            "text": "ÂõæÁâáÁöÑÂÜÖÂÆπÊòØ‰ªÄ‰πàÔºü",
            "image": img,
        },
    },
]

# Convert the conversation to vLLM acceptable format.
prompt = llm.get_tokenizer().apply_chat_template(
    conversation,
    tokenize=False,
    add_generation_prompt=True,
)
vllm_inputs = [
    {
        "prompt": prompt,
        "multi_modal_data": {
            "image": img,
        },
    }
]

# Generate the outputs.
outputs = llm.generate(
    vllm_inputs,
    sampling_params,
)

# Print the outputs.
for output in outputs:
    print(output.outputs[0].text)
```

You can find a complete script in [vllm_demo/example_infer_vllm.py](vllm_demo/example_infer_vllm.py).

## Chat with MegrezO using Gradio

We provide online and local demos powered by Hugging Face Gradio <a href='https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio'><img src='https://img.shields.io/github/stars/gradio-app/gradio'></a>.

### WebUI Demonstration

<div align="center" style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">

</div>

### Online Demo

Please try out our online Demo here: [ü§óMegrez-3B-Omni](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Infinigence/Megrez-3B-Omni)

### Local WebUI Demo
  
You can easily deploy your own local WebUI to chat with MegrezO using Gradio.

1. Install dependencies:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Launch the Gradio app.

You need to specify the `model_path` and `port` in the command line. The `model_path` is the path to the model checkpoint, and the `port` is the port number for the local server. By default, the `port` is `7860`.

```shell
python gradio_app.py --model_path {model_path} --port {port}
```

Then, you can visit `http://localhost:7860` in your browser to interact with the model.

Feel free to modify the `gradio_app.py` to customize the input and output interfaces. For more information, please refer to the [Gradio documentation](https://gradio.app/docs).

## Fine-Tuning the Model

We provide a [fine-tuning example](./finetune/) based on [DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed) and [accelerate](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate).

### Data Preparation

We have constructed a sample dataset based on [ALLaVA-4V/allava_laion](https://huggingface.co/datasets/FreedomIntelligence/ALLaVA-4V/tree/main/allava_laion) dataset:  

- **Dialogue**: [data/train/records.jsonl](./data/train/records.jsonl)  
- **Images**: [data/train/images](./data/train/images)  
- **Audio**: [data/train/audio](./data/train/audio), created by converting dialogue text into speech using TTS.  

You can also prepare your own dataset following the same format.

### Dependencies Installation

Install the required dependencies with the following command:  

```bash
pip install deepspeed accelerate
```

### Full-Parameter Fine-Tuning

To run the fine-tuning example, execute the following commands. Be sure to replace the model path in the script with the path to your downloaded model.  

```bash
cd finetune

sh finetune.sh
```

You can customize the modules to fine-tune by setting the parameters:  
`tune_vision_encoder`, `tune_vision_proj`, `tune_llm`, `tune_audio_encoder`, and `tune_audio_proj`.

### Notes

1. **Recommended Hardware**: Please use at least two GPUs with 80GB memory for fine-tuning.  
2. **If GPU memory is insufficient**:  
   - Adjust the `model_max_length` and `per_device_train_batch_size` parameters.  
   - Disable specific modules for fine-tuning to reduce memory usage.  
   - Optimize memory consumption by configuring the `zero_optimization` parameters in DeepSpeed.
3. **For better inference results**:
   - We recommend to put the images in the first round of chat for better inference results. There are no such restrictions for audio and text, which can be switched freely.
   - In the Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) scenario, simply change content['text'] to "Convert speech to text."
   - In the OCR scenario, enabling sampling may introduce language model hallucinations which cause text changes. Users may consider disabling sampling in inference (sampling=False). However, disabling sampling may introduce model repetition.
